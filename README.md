DCAT-AP Exporter for Dataverse
==============================

This exporter is based on the DCAT-AP specification for describing datasets in a standardized way. It allows users to export metadata from Dataverse repositories into DCAT-AP compliant formats.

If you install it on a test server with production data, you can export from various datasets to get an idea of what data to expect when creating your own exporter.
